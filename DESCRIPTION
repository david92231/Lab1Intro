Description: This package is for Lab 1 of MATH5793 which is to create three R functions for the arrays of basic descriptive statistics.
    First R function will create the sample mean vector that is constructed with a matrix composed of column of sample means
    Second R function creates sample (biased) covariance matrix that is composed of sample variances and covariances.
    Lastly, third R function will create sample correlation matrix.
